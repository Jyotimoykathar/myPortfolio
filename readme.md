## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox Css
- Grid Css

### Time required

Nearly 7 day required to figure out the entire position of the sections in sequence and towards completion.

### Continued development

I still have a lot to learn about CSS Grid and Media Queries.
Animation and JS need to be added to make the page more interactive and beautiful.

### Useful resources

- [ION ICONS](https://ionic.io/ionicons) - This is an amazing website with open source icons that helps to add icons easily to your webpages.
